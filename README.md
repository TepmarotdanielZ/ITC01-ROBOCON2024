##   WHT IS THE ABU ROBOCON?

ABU ROBOCON, short for the Asia-Pacific Robot Contest, stands as a premier robotics competition within the Asian-Oceanian region. This illustrious event was inaugurated in 2002, courtesy of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. ABU ROBOCON serves as an exceptional platform for college students to exhibit their prowess in various domains, including mechanical engineering, electronics, and software development.

##    WHY IS IT SIGNIFICANT THIS YEAR?

The 2024 Asia-Pacific Robocon will be hosted by Vietnam.

The theme of the competition is ‚ÄúHarvest Day,‚Äù inspired by rice cultivation on terraced fields. The balls will represent the rice grains that need to be harvested in the fields. The participating robots will have to perform tasks simulating the rice growing process, from sowing to harvesting.

This year's competition attracted 13 teams from 12 countries and territories.

##    WHO WE ARE?


We are a group of fourth-year students hailing from the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, specializing in Electrical and Energy Engineering, with a major focus on Electronics and Automation. Throughout our journey, we have received invaluable guidance from our dedicated teachers and the wisdom of our seniors, who have played an instrumental role in our pursuit of robot design.

Our preparation for the robot contest was a true educational odyssey. We conducted extensive research into cutting-edge technologies, striving to ensure that our robots would stand at the vanguard of innovation.

## ELECTRONIC

In the realm of electronics, we chose the STM32 microcontroller as the linchpin of our robot's operation. This powerful core was instrumental in managing and controlling the myriad sensors embedded within our robot. Leveraging the flexibility and data scalability offered by CAN-Bus communication over Serial-UART, we also took it upon ourselves to design and implement our proprietary module board.

## PROGRAM ROS2

Our programming endeavors extended beyond mere microcontroller programming. We embarked on a challenging journey to comprehend and harness the capabilities of the Robotics Operating System 2, or ROS2. ROS2 proved to be a versatile software framework, enriched with a treasure trove of open-source software. It facilitated the seamless integration of third-party libraries and frameworks, ultimately bestowing our robot with enhanced functionality

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community. The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isn‚Äôt.

## PROGRAM STM32

TM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. It is based on the Eclipse¬Æ/CDT‚Ñ¢ framework and GCC toolchain for the development, and GDB for the debugging. It allows the integration of the hundreds of existing plugins that complete the features of the Eclipse¬Æ IDE.

STM32CubeIDE integrates STM32 configuration and project creation functionalities from STM32CubeMX to offer all-in-one tool experience and save installation and development time. After the selection of an empty STM32 MCU or MPU, or preconfigured microcontroller or microprocessor from the selection of a board or the selection of an example, the project is created and initialization code generated. At any time during the development, the user can return to the initialization and configuration of the peripherals or middleware and regenerate the initialization code with no impact on the user code.

STM32CubeIDE includes build and stack analyzers that provide the user with useful information about project status and memory requirements.

STM32CubeIDE also includes standard and advanced debugging features including views of CPU core registers, memories, and peripheral registers, as well as live variable watch, Serial Wire Viewer interface, or fault analyzer.

##  MICROCONTROLLER

The microcontroller functions similarly to a brain. It's a simple IC (integrated circuit). The term "micro" refers to a tiny size. Everything is growing smaller in size and performing faster in our technology. Microcontrollers are used in automatically controlled products and devices, such as automobile engine control systems, implantable medical devices, remote controls, office machines, appliances, power tools, toys and other embedded systems. By reducing the size and cost compared to a design that uses a separate microprocessor, memory, and input/output devices, microcontrollers make it economical to control even more devices and processes digitally. In this project, we chose STM32CubeIDE (STM32F407VE)

##  MECHANICAL

Despite the absence of comprehensive coursework in mechanical design, we undertook the daunting task of crafting our robot's mechanical components. This year's mechanical design posed a formidable challenge, yet our determination and perseverance paid off as we completed both robots well in advance of the competition.

## THE GAME OF ROBOCON

  - Terraced fields

For thousands of years, rice has been closely associated with the people of
Vietnam. Rice not only provides sustenance but also becomes a beautiful aspect
of the cultural and spiritual life of the Vietnamese people. Nowadays, rice
serves as both a vital food source and a strategic export commodity for
Vietnam.

There is a unique form of cultivation in the traditional agricultural practices of the
people living in the highland regions of Vietnam, known as terraced fields.

The remarkable feature of terraced fields is that during the harvest season from around June to October, the mountain slopes
resemble a piece of artistic painting carved into the mountains by the local farmers.

The terraced fields are not only beautiful but also the 'rice granary' of the highland people, utilizing the natural conditions for effective cultivation and providing a warm and prosperous life. With these significances, in recent years, terraced fields have become a
highlight in tourism, attracting many domestic and international tourists. They have become a cultural beauty and a source of pride for the Vietnamese people.

Drawing inspiration from cultivation on terraced fields, the ABU Robocon 2024 contest hosted by Vietnam, has developed robot tasks that 
depict the stages of rice cultivation. These tasks include sowing, harvesting, and transporting the harvested grains to the warehouse. The underlying message is 'Efficient cultivation brings a warm and prosperous life for everyone‚Äù

## SENSOR OF ROBOT

  1. NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit

The Jetson AGX Xavier features a NVIDIA Volta 512 core GPU with 64 Tensor cores. Eight Carmel cores (NVIDIA‚Äôs own custom 64-bit ARM cores) make up the CPU complex, in 4 dual-core clusters. The cores implement ARMv8.2 with RAS support. All cores are cache coherent, which extends to the GPU and other onboard accelerators.

The Xavier incorporates dual Programmable Vision Accelerators (PVAs) for helping with common computer vision processing tasks.

Another accelerators on the Tegra chip is the Deep Learning Accelerator (DLA), a hardware implementation of the NVIDIA NVDLA architecture.

Some great information about the actual Tegra Xavier chip is available on WikiChip: Tegra Xavier.
