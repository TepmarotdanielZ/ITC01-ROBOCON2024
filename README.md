##   WHT IS THE ABU ROBOCON?

ABU ROBOCON, short for the Asia-Pacific Robot Contest, stands as a premier robotics competition within the Asian-Oceanian region. This illustrious event was inaugurated in 2002, courtesy of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. ABU ROBOCON serves as an exceptional platform for college students to exhibit their prowess in various domains, including mechanical engineering, electronics, and software development.

##    WHY IS IT SIGNIFICANT THIS YEAR?



##    WHO WE ARE?


We are a group of fourth-year students hailing from the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, specializing in Electrical and Energy Engineering, with a major focus on Electronics and Automation. Throughout our journey, we have received invaluable guidance from our dedicated teachers and the wisdom of our seniors, who have played an instrumental role in our pursuit of robot design.

Our preparation for the robot contest was a true educational odyssey. We conducted extensive research into cutting-edge technologies, striving to ensure that our robots would stand at the vanguard of innovation.

## ELECTRONIC

In the realm of electronics, we chose the STM32 microcontroller as the linchpin of our robot's operation. This powerful core was instrumental in managing and controlling the myriad sensors embedded within our robot. Leveraging the flexibility and data scalability offered by CAN-Bus communication over Serial-UART, we also took it upon ourselves to design and implement our proprietary module board.

## PROGRAM ROS2

Our programming endeavors extended beyond mere microcontroller programming. We embarked on a challenging journey to comprehend and harness the capabilities of the Robotics Operating System 2, or ROS2. ROS2 proved to be a versatile software framework, enriched with a treasure trove of open-source software. It facilitated the seamless integration of third-party libraries and frameworks, ultimately bestowing our robot with enhanced functionality

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community. The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isn’t.

## PROGRAM STM32

TM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. It is based on the Eclipse®/CDT™ framework and GCC toolchain for the development, and GDB for the debugging. It allows the integration of the hundreds of existing plugins that complete the features of the Eclipse® IDE.

STM32CubeIDE integrates STM32 configuration and project creation functionalities from STM32CubeMX to offer all-in-one tool experience and save installation and development time. After the selection of an empty STM32 MCU or MPU, or preconfigured microcontroller or microprocessor from the selection of a board or the selection of an example, the project is created and initialization code generated. At any time during the development, the user can return to the initialization and configuration of the peripherals or middleware and regenerate the initialization code with no impact on the user code.

STM32CubeIDE includes build and stack analyzers that provide the user with useful information about project status and memory requirements.

STM32CubeIDE also includes standard and advanced debugging features including views of CPU core registers, memories, and peripheral registers, as well as live variable watch, Serial Wire Viewer interface, or fault analyzer.
