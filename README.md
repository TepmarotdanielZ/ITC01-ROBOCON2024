##   WHT IS THE ABU ROBOCON?

ABU ROBOCON, short for the Asia-Pacific Robot Contest, stands as a premier robotics competition within the Asian-Oceanian region. This illustrious event was inaugurated in 2002, courtesy of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. ABU ROBOCON serves as an exceptional platform for college students to exhibit their prowess in various domains, including mechanical engineering, electronics, and software development.

##    WHY IS IT SIGNIFICANT THIS YEAR?



##    WHO WE ARE?


We are a group of fourth-year students hailing from the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, specializing in Electrical and Energy Engineering, with a major focus on Electronics and Automation. Throughout our journey, we have received invaluable guidance from our dedicated teachers and the wisdom of our seniors, who have played an instrumental role in our pursuit of robot design.

Our preparation for the robot contest was a true educational odyssey. We conducted extensive research into cutting-edge technologies, striving to ensure that our robots would stand at the vanguard of innovation.

## ELECTRONIC

In the realm of electronics, we chose the STM32 microcontroller as the linchpin of our robot's operation. This powerful core was instrumental in managing and controlling the myriad sensors embedded within our robot. Leveraging the flexibility and data scalability offered by CAN-Bus communication over Serial-UART, we also took it upon ourselves to design and implement our proprietary module board.

## PROGRAM ROS2

Our programming endeavors extended beyond mere microcontroller programming. We embarked on a challenging journey to comprehend and harness the capabilities of the Robotics Operating System 2, or ROS2. ROS2 proved to be a versatile software framework, enriched with a treasure trove of open-source software. It facilitated the seamless integration of third-party libraries and frameworks, ultimately bestowing our robot with enhanced functionality

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community. The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isnâ€™t.
